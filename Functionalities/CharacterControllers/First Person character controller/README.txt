This is edited version of Jess Case character controller made to work with the new input system for unity.
Most of the original code is still there just commented out if you want to know how the original worked 
you can look trought the commented code. 
Please also take a look at Jess Case original documentation on how to use this asset
it should work for the most part. I have taken out of lot of the hold to do x features 
instead they are toggles. This is due to Unity New input system disliking button held.
