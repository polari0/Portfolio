This was a system that I developed to load OBJ files from any given dictionary from your PC in unity runtime 
It was build on top of the following unity asset 
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/runtime-obj-importer-49547
https://github.com/PhalanxHead/UnityRuntimeOBJLoaderDocs.git

This was made to work with the UI buttons but can be easily edited for differnt purposes as well
